/*

A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building.
 The height h of this floor is known. He drops the ball out of the window.
 The ball bounces to two thirds of it's height, i.e. 0.66.
  His brother looks on from a window that is 1.5m from the ground.

How many times will the brother see the ball pass his window (including the time the ball falls and whilst its bouncing)?
Assume you have the following arguments to your function:
h is a float that is greater than 0
bounce is a float that is greater than 0 and less than 1
window must be less than h
If all of the above argument criterias are matched, return the outcome of occurrences, as an integer, otherwise return -1
